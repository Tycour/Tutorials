        "- Install VSCode - text/code editor: https://code.visualstudio.com/\n",
        "- Install miniconda (Python 3.7, 64bit): https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html\n",
        "- Create a working folder named `coding_club` on your computer. This is where you're going to store all the data and scripts.\n",

        "\n",
        "We are going to create a new fresh conda environment - packages installed in this conda environment are going to be isolated from the rest of the system and prevent different versions of packages clash together and cause havoc.\n",
